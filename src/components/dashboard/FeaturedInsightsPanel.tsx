The most rigorous of these, an analysis of 2.43 billion impressions across 53 brands by Seer Interactive, found that organic CTR collapsed from 1.76% to 0.61% once Google started answering the question directly on the results page instead of sending the user to a website to find the answer.",

Meanwhile 94% of B2B buyers now say they use tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Perplexity to research vendors before they ever contact a sales team. Your prospects are forming an opinion about your business inside a chat window before your website ever gets a look."

Research from BrightEdge and Amsive found that AI platforms cite only 3 to 4 brands per response on average, and the top 20 domains capture 66% of all AI citations. It's not a level playing field — it's a short list. And once a company gets left off that list a few times, the model reinforces the same short list again and again.",
          "The kicker: a study of 400 senior marketing executives found only about 11% of B2B brands have the majority of their content structured to be AI-discovery ready. That means roughly 9 out of 10 businesses reading this are functionally invisible to the exact tool their customers are now using to make buying decisions."
